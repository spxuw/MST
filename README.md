# Ecological Dynamics Imposes Fundamental Challenges in Microbial Source Tracking.
This repository contains the code used in paper "Ecological Dynamics Imposes Fundamental Challenges in Microbial Source Tracking".

## System requirements
All codes were tested in R 4.1.2 on a macOS machine.

## R packages
randomForest\
FEAST\
Sourcetracker\
Seqtime

## Guide
Seqtime package is used to generate the simulated data. FEAST, Sourcetracker and randomforest are three microbial source tracking solvers.
After installation of R pakckages, users can directly run the code.
